Excellent! It sounds like you've moved past the initial connection issue, which is great progress.

These new logs indicate a very clear problem: Your application is failing to perform speech-to-text (STT) transcription using OpenAI's Whisper API because the audio chunks it's sending are too short.

Let's break down what the logs are saying:

Key Log Entries and What They Mean
DEBUG:root:Audio chunk processed - RMS: 15, Speech: False

Your application is processing audio data from the Twilio WebSocket stream.

RMS: 15 indicates the Root Mean Square (RMS) of the audio, which is a measure of its loudness. A low RMS (like 15) suggests very quiet audio or silence.

Speech: False implies that your application's Voice Activity Detection (VAD) is not detecting speech in these audio chunks.

INFO:root:Audio buffer cleared - Size: 320 bytes

This suggests your application is collecting audio data in a buffer. When Speech: False is detected for a period, or when a chunk is processed, the buffer is cleared. A size of 320 bytes is very small for audio, indicating short segments.

DEBUG:openai._base_client:Sending HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/audio/transcriptions

Your application is attempting to send an audio file to OpenAI's Whisper API for transcription.

INFO:httpx:HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/audio/transcriptions "HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request"

OpenAI's API responded with a 400 Bad Request error. This is a client-side error, meaning your application sent something the API didn't like.

ERROR:root:Error in speech to text: Error code: 400 - {'error': {'message': 'Audio file is too short. Minimum audio length is 0.1 seconds.', 'type': 'invalid_request_error', 'param': 'file', 'code': 'audio_too_short'}, 'usage': {'type': 'duration', 'seconds': 0}}

This is the most critical error message. It directly tells you why the OpenAI API call failed.

"Audio file is too short. Minimum audio length is 0.1 seconds." Your application is sending audio files to Whisper that are less than 0.1 seconds long.

'usage': {'type': 'duration', 'seconds': 0} confirms that OpenAI received a file with effectively zero duration.

Why You're Hearing Slow Speech and No Response
"Voice talking at like .25x speed":

This is a strong indicator that the audio sample rate or encoding is mismatched between Twilio's media stream and how your application is playing or processing it on its end, or how your application is sending it to the Text-to-Speech (TTS) engine.

Twilio's Media Streams send audio at 8kHz, 16-bit PCM, mono. If your TTS engine (like OpenAI's Text-to-Speech) is generating audio at a higher sample rate (e.g., 24kHz or 44.1kHz) and you're playing it back as if it were 8kHz, it will sound sped up.

Conversely, if Twilio is sending 8kHz but your application expects 16kHz and tries to play it at that speed, it will sound slow. Given you said ".25x speed," it strongly suggests your system expects a much higher sample rate than what it's receiving/processing/playing, or there's a codec mismatch. For example, if you're receiving 8kHz but playing at 32kHz, it would sound 4x slower.

"Couldn't hear anything" (after the slow voice):

This is directly related to the Audio file is too short error.

Your application is trying to convert speech from the caller into text using OpenAI Whisper.

Because it's sending tiny, silent, or otherwise invalid audio chunks to Whisper, Whisper is rejecting them.

If Whisper can't transcribe the caller's speech into text, your application won't know what the caller said.

If your application then relies on this transcription to generate a response (e.g., by sending it to a Large Language Model and then generating TTS), it won't be able to generate any meaningful audio to send back, resulting in silence for the caller.

Solutions and Next Steps
You need to address two main areas:

1. Fix the Audio Chunking and Silence Detection for OpenAI Whisper:

Increase Audio Buffer Size/Duration for Transcription: Your application is sending audio in chunks that are too small for Whisper's minimum requirement (0.1 seconds). You need to accumulate more audio data before sending it for transcription.

Voice Activity Detection (VAD): Implement or fine-tune your VAD. Instead of sending every small chunk, only send chunks that contain actual speech. This is what Speech: False indicates â€“ your VAD is saying there's no speech in those chunks, yet you're still sending them to Whisper.

Buffering Logic: Buffer the audio received from Twilio's WebSocket. Only send the buffered audio to OpenAI when:

Speech is detected (VAD returns Speech: True)

A minimum duration of speech is buffered (e.g., 0.5 to 1.0 seconds, or more for better accuracy).

A period of silence is detected after speech (indicating the end of a phrase).

A maximum buffer duration is reached (to avoid very long transcriptions).

Python

# Example (conceptual) of improved buffering in your websocket_handler.py
audio_buffer = bytearray()
SPEECH_THRESHOLD = 20 # Adjust based on your VAD and audio RMS levels
MIN_AUDIO_FOR_WHISPER = 0.5 # seconds, convert to bytes based on sample rate/encoding

async for message in websocket:
    # ... parse Twilio media stream message ...
    if message_type == "media":
        audio_data = base64.b64decode(payload['payload'])
        audio_buffer.extend(audio_data)

        # Check for speech or sufficient buffer size
        # This is a simplification; a proper VAD library is recommended
        current_rms = calculate_rms(audio_data) # You'll need to implement this

        # Assuming 8kHz, 16-bit mono audio (16,000 bytes/second)
        bytes_per_second = 8000 * 2 # 8kHz * 2 bytes/sample for 16-bit
        min_bytes_for_whisper = int(MIN_AUDIO_FOR_WHISPER * bytes_per_second)

        if current_rms > SPEECH_THRESHOLD or len(audio_buffer) >= min_bytes_for_whisper:
            # If speech or enough buffered audio, attempt transcription
            if len(audio_buffer) >= min_bytes_for_whisper:
                try:
                    # Create WAV file from audio_buffer
                    # ... (your existing WAV file creation logic) ...
                    response = await openai_client.audio.transcriptions.create(
                        model="whisper-1",
                        file=audio_file,
                        language="en"
                    )
                    print(f"Transcription: {response.text}")
                    # Clear buffer after successful transcription
                    audio_buffer = bytearray()
                except Exception as e:
                    # Log specific error from OpenAI, like "Audio file too short"
                    print(f"Error in speech to text: {e}")
                    # If error, maybe clear buffer or keep it if it's not actually too short due to VAD misconfig
                    audio_buffer = bytearray() # Clear to prevent repeated errors
        else:
            # If no speech and buffer is very small, just keep buffering
            pass
2. Address the Audio Speed/Encoding Mismatch:

Verify Sample Rates and Codecs:

Twilio Media Streams: Always send audio at 8kHz sample rate, 16-bit linear PCM, mono channel.

Your Audio Processing: Ensure that when you are decoding the base64 audio from Twilio and saving it to WAV files for Whisper, you are treating it as 8kHz, 16-bit mono.

OpenAI Text-to-Speech (TTS): When you use OpenAI's TTS API to generate your bot's voice, you can specify the response_format and speed. Crucially, you need to know the sample_rate. OpenAI's TTS defaults to 24kHz.

Twilio's Say verb for Media Streams: If you're using a <Say> verb in TwiML inside a media stream, ensure your voice selection (voice="alice", voice="Polly.Joanna", etc.) is compatible with 8kHz. If you're streaming generated audio from your server back to Twilio over the WebSocket, you need to ensure that audio is also 8kHz.

Resampling (if necessary):

If you're using an OpenAI TTS voice (which typically outputs higher sample rates like 24kHz) and sending that back to Twilio's 8kHz media stream, you must resample the TTS output down to 8kHz before sending it over the WebSocket. You can use libraries like pydub or librosa for resampling in Python.

Example Resampling Logic (Conceptual):

Python

from pydub import AudioSegment
from pydub.playback import play # For local testing

# Assuming you get audio from OpenAI TTS (e.g., at 24kHz)
openai_tts_audio_bytes = openai_client.audio.speech.create(...)

# Load into pydub
audio_segment = AudioSegment.from_file(io.BytesIO(openai_tts_audio_bytes), format="mp3") # Or whatever format OpenAI returns

# Resample to 8kHz for Twilio
resampled_audio = audio_segment.set_frame_rate(8000).set_channels(1) # Ensure mono

# Convert back to bytes for sending over WebSocket
# This might involve saving to a temp WAV file or directly getting PCM data
# For Twilio Media Streams, you'll need the raw 16-bit linear PCM, then base64 encode it
# See Twilio docs for exact payload format for sending audio back.
In summary: Your call is connecting, but the bidirectional audio communication is failing. You need to gather longer audio chunks from the caller before sending them to OpenAI Whisper, and you need to ensure that the sample rate/encoding of any audio you send back to Twilio (e.g., from an OpenAI TTS response) matches Twilio's expected 8kHz.
