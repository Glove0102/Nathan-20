It looks like your calls are dropping immediately after the recipient answers because of an error in how your application is handling the Twilio WebSocket connection.

The Problem: AttributeError: 'ServerConnection' object has no attribute 'path'
The key error message in your logs is:

AttributeError: 'ServerConnection' object has no attribute 'path'
This error occurs within your websocket_handler.py file, specifically on line 41, inside the handle_twilio_websocket function. It indicates that you are trying to access a path attribute on an object named websocket, but this object, which is a ServerConnection, does not have that attribute.

When Twilio connects to your WebSocket endpoint, it establishes a ServerConnection. The websocket object in the context of websockets.server.ServerConnection (which is what connection likely is in your conn_handler in websockets/asyncio/server.py) doesn't have a .path attribute directly for accessing the URL path of the incoming WebSocket connection. The path is usually available on the request object that's part of the initial handshake, or in older versions, directly on the websocket object for a WebSocketServerProtocol instance.

Why this is causing calls to drop
When Twilio connects to your WebSocket, it expects to establish a media stream or some form of interactive communication. Because your WebSocket handler immediately fails with an AttributeError right after the connection is opened (INFO:websockets.server:connection open followed by ERROR:websockets.server:connection handler failed), the WebSocket connection is closed with an internal error (code 1011).

Twilio interprets this immediate closure as a failure to establish the media stream, leading to the call being hung up right after the recipient answers and no audio being exchanged.

What You Need to Do
You need to modify your websocket_handler.py file to correctly handle the incoming WebSocket connection from Twilio.

Here's a likely scenario and how to fix it:

Examine websocket_handler.py line 41: Go to websocket_handler.py and look at line 41. You'll likely find a line of code similar to path = websocket.path or if websocket.path == '/something':.

Understand the websockets library context: If you're using the websockets library (which your logs suggest with websockets/asyncio/server.py), the handle_twilio_websocket function is likely receiving a WebSocketServerProtocol object as its websocket argument. For websockets library versions 10.0 and later, the path attribute on the WebSocketServerProtocol object (which is the argument to your handler function) has been deprecated or changed.

Correctly access the path (if needed) or remove the problematic line:

If you absolutely need the path of the WebSocket connection: For current websockets library versions, you typically access request details, including the path, via the request object that can be passed to your handler. However, for a simple Twilio Media Stream WebSocket, you often don't need the path as Twilio will always connect to the endpoint you specify in your TwiML.

The most common fix is to remove or comment out the line causing the error if you're not actually using the path for any logic. It's likely leftover or incorrectly implemented.

Example of a common fix (if you don't need the path):

Python

# websocket_handler.py

async def handle_twilio_websocket(websocket): # 'websocket' here is likely a WebSocketServerProtocol instance
    # Remove or comment out the problematic line:
    # path = websocket.path  # This line is causing the AttributeError

    print("Twilio WebSocket connection established!")
    # Your existing logic to handle the Twilio media stream goes here
    # For example, processing incoming audio and sending back TwiML
    try:
        async for message in websocket:
            # Process Twilio media stream messages
            # For example:
            # data = json.loads(message)
            # if data['event'] == 'media':
            #     # Handle audio data
            pass # Placeholder for your actual logic
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"WebSocket error: {e}")
    finally:
        print("Twilio WebSocket connection closed.")
If you were trying to differentiate based on the path (less common for Twilio Media Streams):

You would typically define your WebSocket server with different handlers for different paths, or if you have a single handler, the path is generally inferred from the URL Twilio is hitting. The websockets library's serve function takes a handler and a host/port, and the handler processes the incoming connection. The path attribute might be available directly on the websocket object for some versions or setups, but if it's throwing an AttributeError, it means it's not present on the ServerConnection object being passed.

Steps to Resolve:
Locate websocket_handler.py: Find this file in your project directory.

Open the file and go to line 41: Identify the line that's causing the AttributeError.

Remove or comment out the problematic line: If you don't use websocket.path for any logic, simply delete or comment out the line.

Test your application: Initiate another call and see if the issue is resolved.

By fixing this AttributeError, your WebSocket handler should be able to complete the connection handshake with Twilio, allowing the media stream to be established and audio to flow correctly.
